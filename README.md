This projects works by fetching data through SWAPI, a Star Wars API, and displaying it on this page. 
Click the links for which information you would like to see, for example films, and a list of the films will be displayed on a new page.

Background images are created by ChatGPT as to not infringe on any copyright laws. 
Fonts are from Google Fonts and the svg for the refresh button (in case of error) is from Font Awesome.
All other images are fetched from googling.
This is a study project and is not used commercially.
